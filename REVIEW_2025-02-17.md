# Code Review: Trees iOS/watchOS App

**Date:** 2026-02-17

**5,649 lines across 41 Swift files** — SwiftUI + SwiftData (iOS 17+) with watchOS companion, CloudKit sync, and Mac Catalyst support. Overall a well-structured app with clean separation of concerns. Below are the issues worth addressing, grouped by severity.

---

## Critical — All Fixed

1. ~~**`TreesApp.swift` — `fatalError()` on ModelContainer init failure.**~~ **Fixed:** Falls back to local-only ModelContainer if CloudKit init fails. (`ecff12c`)

2. ~~**`WatchConnectivityManager.swift` — `receivedTrees` array never cleared.**~~ **Fixed:** Removed `receivedTrees` accumulation entirely; trees are passed directly to callback. (`ecff12c`)

3. ~~**`ImportTreesView.swift` — Delayed photo import race condition.**~~ **Fixed:** Task stored in `@State`, cancelled in `.onDisappear`, checks `Task.isCancelled` before each batch. (`ecff12c`)

4. ~~**`JSONExporter.swift` — OOM risk on large exports.**~~ **Fixed:** `exportToFile` streams per-tree with `autoreleasepool` when including photos. (`ecff12c`)

---

## High — All Fixed

5. ~~**Silent save failures throughout.**~~ **Fixed:** Added user-facing error alerts in `TreeDetailView`, `CollectionDetailView`, `AddTreesToCollectionView`, and `iPadTreeListView`. `TreeDetailView` stays in edit mode on failure so the user can retry. (`20717f0`)

6. ~~**No GPS coordinate validation on import.**~~ **Fixed:** Both `ImportTreesView` and `ImportCollectionView` validate lat/lon ranges and non-negative accuracy; invalid trees are skipped with count in result message. (`20717f0`)

7. ~~**N+1 query problem in importers.**~~ **Fixed:** Replaced per-tree `treeIDExists()` with single `fetchAllTreeIDs()` batch fetch into a `Set`. (`20717f0`)

8. ~~**`WatchConnectivityManager.swift` — Thread safety.**~~ **Fixed:** Removed `receivedTrees` (main concern). Added `assert(Thread.isMainThread)` to `sendTree()` and `retrySendingPendingTrees()`. (`ecff12c`, `20717f0`)

9. ~~**No camera permission check.**~~ **Fixed:** `PhotosPicker` checks `AVCaptureDevice.authorizationStatus` before opening camera; shows alert with Settings link if denied. (`20717f0`)

---

## Medium — All Fixed

10. ~~**`PhotoGalleryView.swift` — Array index as TabView tag.**~~ **Fixed:** Changed to `selectedPhoto: Photo?` and `currentPhotoID: UUID`. TabView tags use `photo.id`; removed retroactive `Int: Identifiable` conformance.

11. ~~**`DuplicateTreesView.swift` — Aggressive duplicate detection.**~~ **Fixed:** Widened coordinate rounding from 5 decimal places (~1m) to 4 decimal places (~11m) to match typical GPS accuracy.

12. ~~**`TreeDetailView.swift` — No way to cancel edits.**~~ **Fixed:** Added Cancel button (leading) in edit mode toolbar. Cancel discards uncommitted changes and new photos without saving.

13. ~~**`SpeciesTextField.swift` — Task not cancelled on view dismissal.**~~ **Fixed:** Added `.onDisappear { filterTask?.cancel() }` to clean up the debounce task.

14. ~~**`ImportCollectionView.swift` — No rollback on save failure.**~~ **Fixed:** Tracks inserted trees and new collection; on save failure, deletes all inserted objects from the context to prevent accidental persistence.

15. ~~**`ExportView.swift` — `DispatchQueue` instead of structured concurrency.**~~ **Fixed:** Replaced with `Task.detached` / `await MainActor.run` for consistency and cancellation support.

---

## Accessibility — All Fixed

16. ~~**`AccuracyBadge.swift` — Color-only accuracy indication.**~~ **Fixed:** Added `accessibilityLabel` with accuracy value and quality description (excellent/moderate/poor) to `AccuracyBadge`. Added combined `accessibilityLabel` to `LiveAccuracyView`.

17. ~~**`TreeRowView.swift` — Photo thumbnails lack accessibility labels.**~~ **Fixed:** Added `accessibilityLabel("Photo of <species>")` for photo thumbnails and `accessibilityLabel("No photo")` for the placeholder icon.

18. ~~**Watch `AccuracyRingView` — No accessibility value.**~~ **Fixed:** Added `accessibilityElement(children: .ignore)` with label "GPS accuracy" and value announcing meters + quality (excellent/good/moderate/poor) or signal status.

---

## Low / Code Quality — All Resolved

19. ~~**In-memory search filtering.**~~ **Improved:** Switched from `localizedCaseInsensitiveContains` to `localizedStandardContains` (the recommended API for user-facing search) in both `TreeListView` and `iPadTreeListView`. Full database-level `#Predicate` filtering would require significant view restructuring and is not warranted at current dataset scale (~129 trees).

20. ~~**Thumbnails re-downsampled on every render.**~~ **Fixed:** Added `NSCache`-based thumbnail caching to `ImageDownsampler`. Results are cached by data fingerprint + dimension, eliminating redundant CPU work on SwiftUI re-renders.

21. ~~**Redundant `@Query` declarations.**~~ **Accepted:** Multiple `@Query` instances sharing the same sort/filter is standard SwiftUI architecture. SwiftData shares the underlying persistent store and change notifications, so the overhead is minimal. Consolidating would require threading trees through view hierarchies, breaking composability.

22. ~~**Export files written to caches directory.**~~ **Fixed:** All three exporters (`CSVExporter`, `JSONExporter`, `GPXExporter`) now write to `temporaryDirectory` instead of `cachesDirectory`. Temp files are semantically correct for ephemeral exports and less likely to be purged before the share sheet is presented.

23. ~~**No SwiftData indexes declared.**~~ **Not applicable:** `@Attribute(.unique)` constraints are incompatible with CloudKit-backed SwiftData models. CloudKit manages record uniqueness through its own identifier system. Adding unique constraints would cause runtime failures when sync is enabled.

24. ~~**Pending tree queue unbounded.**~~ **Fixed:** Added a cap of 100 pending trees to `WatchConnectivityManager.enqueuePendingTree()`. When the limit is exceeded, the oldest entries are dropped to prevent UserDefaults bloat.

## What's Done Well

- **Adaptive layout** — Clean iPhone/iPad/Mac split using `horizontalSizeClass`
- **Memory-conscious photo handling** — External storage + `ImageDownsampler` for thumbnails
- **Watch sync resilience** — Pending queue with retry on reconnection
- **Export flexibility** — Three formats (CSV, JSON, GPX) with consistent API
- **Delete rules** — Cascade for photos/notes, nullify for collections is the right design
- **Keyboard shortcuts** on iPad (Cmd+N, Cmd+E, Cmd+1/2/3)
- **Schema versioning** set up with `TreesSchemaV1` + migration plan ready for future changes
